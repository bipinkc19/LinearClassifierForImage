# LinearClassifierForImage
## Uses matrix multiplication of linear regression to predict whether an image is cat or a dog
## Vizualize the weights of the equation Y = mX + c, i.e. m, to see how the model is classifying
## The main purpose was to learn how tensor addition and multiplication can be used to solve hardest of problems.
# If you are interested in learning more about image classification, I have implemented the same problem using VNN and Transfer learning.
